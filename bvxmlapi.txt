The BullionVault XML API

Abstract

There are two interfaces into the BullionVault system: The normal GUI interface for users and an XML interface for trading robots. While the XML interface is not considered a primary BullionVault service, it can be used to greatly simplify the development of trading robots.
This document describes the XML interface, giving a bot writer sufficient information to get started. It is not a comprehensive guide, nor does it give any information on trading strategies.

Audience

This document is aimed at programmers. In particularly, the reader should be familiar with CGI and the HTTP request/response protocol as well as XML file formats.

Disclaimer

The XML interface is supplied as is, with no warranty or support. BullionVault itself uses the interface, and for this reason has a vested interest in its accuracy and stability, however BullionVault makes no guarantees of the stability of the interface or the accuracy of the information it provides.

Trading involves risk of financial loss. Automated trading involves many additional risks including accuracy of information, reliability of connections, speed of system response, etc. By using the XML API you accept all risks involved, including, but not limited to financial loss for any reason.

BullionVault reserves the right to charge or suspend clients whose robots use excessive system resources. Please poll the system within sensible limits.

Updates

Updates to the XML API and other technical announcements are posted in the technical section of our news site. Users of the XML API should subscribe to the RSS feed to stay informed.

Overview

The BullionVault API operates in a similar fashion to the normal GUI site. CGI parameters are submitted and a response is sent back from the server. The key difference is that the response is XML rather than HTML. As such, it should be relatively easy for a skilled programmer to interface with the system and trade by wire. All the GUI pages which are necessary for trading (e.g. the market viewer) have XML equivalents. Most auxilliary pages not necessary for trading (e.g. statements and account settings) have no XML equivalent and must be used manually.

Security

BullionVault uses an enhanced login protocol comprising of a normal username & password login together with an optional (but recommended) memorable information check. Any sensitive or valuable communications will be performed over this secure connection. Publically available information, such as viewing the market, can be accessed using an unsecured HTTP connection. Please note that our webservers use a session cookie to track your login session (JSESSIONID). Your robot must treat cookies in a similar fashion to a normal browser, or your login will be continually forgotten.

On first requesting a secure page using an HTTPS client, the user or bot is temporarily diverted to a username/password screen at:

https://live.bullionvault.com/secure/login.do
This screen's CGI parameters j_username j_password to be submitted to:

https://live.bullionvault.com/secure/j_security_check?j_username=XXX&j_password=YYY
On success, the user is then either logged in or will be shown the memorable information check page if this security enhancement is enabled..
There is no XML equivalent of the memorable information check page. To simplify processing of this check, the bot can inspect a META tag in the html head section of the challenge, which appears as follows:

<meta name="X-Challenge" CONTENT="0,2,5"/>
Three characters must be correctly submitted to the server. The CONTENT attribute gives the position of these characters, zero-indexed. Thus in the example above the bot must submit the first, third and sixth memorable information characters as response[0], response[1] and response[2].
For example, if the memorable information is 'ABCDEFGHI' the correct submission will be:
https://live.bullionvault.com/secure/second_login.do?response[0]=A&response[1]=C&response[2]=F
After successfully logging in the user can now access secure pages.

Frequently Asked Questions

Q. Where can I find more information?
A. Your best source of information is to trace the client GUI. The XML API and the client GUI are functionally the same - the real difference is how the data is presented.
If you use Firefox you may find Firebug helpful in tracing the flow of information.

Q. Can you add feature X?
A. Possibly, though development of the XML API is not a current priority. Please email any suggestions to xmlapi@BullionVault.com.

Q. How current is the XML data?
A. As current as the GUI data. They are both generated from the same source. Only the presentation differs.

Q. Is there a public test server available?
A. No, but if there is sufficient demand we would consider it. Please email any suggestions to xmlapi@BullionVault.com.
